# 🛡️ SafePath — AI-Powered Smart Safety Navigation System

## 🌐 Overview

**SafePath** is an AI-powered web platform designed to enhance urban safety and navigation. It provides **real-time safe route detection**, helping users avoid unsafe areas and travel confidently—especially during late hours or in unfamiliar locations.

The system integrates **AI-driven analytics**, **crowdsourced safety data**, and **smart mapping** to suggest the most secure routes between two locations.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In urban environments, **personal safety during travel**—especially for women and night-time commuters—is a growing concern. Conventional navigation apps focus on **shortest distance**, not **safest path**.

**SafePath** aims to solve this by introducing a safety-based routing system that:

- Considers **crime data**, **lighting conditions**, and **public activity levels**.  
- Suggests **alternative routes** prioritizing safety over distance.  
- Integrates with **real-time alerts** and **emergency assistance**.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🔍 **AI-Based Safe Route Detection** — Real-time analysis of location safety.  
- 🗺️ **Interactive Smart Map** — Displays safe, moderate, and unsafe zones.  
- 🧠 **Crowdsourced Safety Reports** — Users can flag unsafe areas or incidents.  
- 📊 **Safety Index Calculation** — Combines environmental and user data.  
- 🚨 **Emergency Mode** — Quick access to SOS and nearby help centers.  
- 📈 **Analytics Dashboard** — Visual insights on safety trends across the city.
